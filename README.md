# Hello and welcome to wannaWatch!

Everybody has a TV show recommendation these days.. How are we supposed to keep all these shows in our tiny little brains!? 

## FEAR NOT

The app is pretty simple: 

Type in your name,
throw in a few shows you'd like to remind yourself, or a friend, to watch in the future.  
wannaWatch will save those shows on a post it for you every time you come back to the page until you'd like to trash it.

Never forget what you wanna watch or just snoop to see what your friends or loved ones wanna watch!

## Origins

The initial reason I built this app was to solve a real life problem: It's hard for me and my partner to agree on a show to watch. Although I'm happy with how it turned out, there is more functionality I'd like top add to really make this app come to life. 
### Namely:

- Adding in Authoriztion so that multiple people can share the same wannaWatch account to properly compare watch lists. 
  - maybe have the app check for similarities between lists and prompt the user(s) about what folks should watch together

- Adding an API call to the input functionality so that a user can read a little about shows before locking it in. 
    - when the user saves a list, the Shows will carry with them information about what streaming services they can watch it on, for further convenience. 

## Excited to bring this app to the next level! Thanks for checking it out ðŸ˜ƒ
